        In order to do this, the user must comply with the applicable guidelines.
        <br />
        When writing a rating or comment, your feedback should be clear and consistent. For example, "I'll get off." or "It's [genre name]. I'm leaving."

        This is a case of not respecting a particular culture. Leaving feedback based solely on your own point of view is not permitted on Louibooks.
